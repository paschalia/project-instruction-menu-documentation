# UX Exploration

Although the website is not complex in the number of pages or the amount of features, it's important to explore different ways to envision how users will interact with the content. The core of the website is an interactive "class builder" feature that allows users to drag tiles into a drop-zone. This requires some experimentation and research to determine how best to design the UI with user needs in mind.
