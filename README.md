# Project Documentation - Interactive Instruction Menu for Library Services

#### Overview & Purpose

The library offers in-class instruction to our faculty. The instruction includes a wide range of different literacies. Librarians want a website offering a comprehensive list of library instructional topics and activities. They also want a way to select and organize instructionl topics into a class. Finally, they want a means of saving the constructed class for future use and review.

The purpose of this project is to develop a website that accomplishes the goals listed above. The website will be interactive and allow users to experiment creating different classes via a class builder tool. The website's aim is to communicate the entire catalog of library instructional services as well as help faculty and librarians to collaborate and organize instruction into classes.
