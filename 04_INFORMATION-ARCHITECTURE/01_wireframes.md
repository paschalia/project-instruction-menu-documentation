# Wireframes

The wireframes reflect the major components of the website - the class builder process, the sample class examples, and the instructional services in a data table. The major component of the class builder is a drag and drop concept. Some variations on the drag and drop component were also developed.

#### The Starting Page

A user encounters the class builder with some instructions to drag an instruction component from the left side to the right side in the drop zone.

#### Building the Class

Once the user has begun to add components the drop zone the class begins to stack. The components can be reordered to reflect a sequence for instruction.

#### User Input

Once the user has finished building a class, the next button will bring the user to a details form, where information about the class date, time, etc. is collected.

#### Pre-filled Class Examples

Users can also view prebuilt class examples and potentially use it directly for a class they want to request.

#### Drag and Drop Component Development

Various concepts were developed for the drag and drop component as part of the wireframe exploration.
