# User Flows

The basic user flow for the website consists of a user 

1. Entering the website and entering their name, date of the class, time length for the instruction and any other information

1. Using the class builder tool to construct the instruction elements and order

1. Saving or exporting a finalized class structure outline

An alternative user flow consists of a user

1. Beginning the interaction with the class builder immediately upon entering the site, with minimal user input needed

1. Once they've built a class, then they enter their name, date of the class, time length for the instruction and any other information

1. Saving or exporting a finalized class structure outline
