# Project Overview

## The Backstory

The university library provides instructional services to help students make the best use of the library's resources and knowledge. This service includes in-class instruction for a variety of different information and/or digital literacy needs. The needs of the students vary depending on the experience of the students and the nature of the assignments they're given. The library wants to provide better communication about what services it can provide and give professors the ability to review and select distinctive segments to include in an information literacy instruction session.

## The Problem

Previously librarians met with professors to discuss the possible areas of instruction. The conversations were useful but not necessarily comprehensive in discussing the possible instruction offerings. Sometimes librarians or instructors would not communicate what was needed or possible. This sometimes resulted in either an instruction session that missed some key areas that were important for student understanding or an instruction session that had a disconnect between what the professor wanted and what the librarian thought was needed.

Another issue is that librarians need a tool that helps to organize what the library is offering as instructional services. Statistical information is needed to help librarians better understand what instructional services are most utilized.

## The Solution

To solve this problem, the library is proposing to create a menu of instructional services. The menu of services will provide a visual and interactive online space for professors and librarians to view what instructional services are available, devise lesson plan outlines, and determine the order and length of instruction. The solution will also include the capability of professors and librarians to create customized instruction plans and export those plans either by email and/or print.

The website will also save statistical information that can be reviewed to see what instruction is most popular.
